# Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Strategy Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an end-to-end **Customer Churn Prediction System** using **Machine Learning**. The model predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a service based on their behavior and demographic data. Additionally, it provides insights to help businesses improve customer retention.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Load and clean real-world datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze key trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Select and create meaningful features.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Compare different ML algorithms.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model using Flask/FastAPI & create a simple dashboard.
- **Business Insights**: Generate actionable insights for customer retention.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Model Deployment**: Flask/FastAPI, Streamlit/Power BI
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset can be sourced from **Kaggle/UCI datasets**.
- It includes customer demographics, usage behavior, and engagement details.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itstalmeez/customer_churn_prediction_and_retention_strategy_using_ml
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash

   ```
5. Start the Flask API (or FastAPI):
   ```bash
   python app/app.py
   ```
6. Open the Streamlit dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/dashboard.py
   ```

## 🔍 Model Performance & Evaluation
- **Metrics Used**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Best Model**: XGBoost (Fine-tuned for optimal performance)

## 📈 Business Insights & Impact
- Identify high-risk customers before they churn.
- Implement targeted marketing strategies to retain customers.
- Optimize business operations based on customer behavior.
